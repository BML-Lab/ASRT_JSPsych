# ASRT_JSPsych
 A simple Alternating Serial Reaction Time Task.

The first version contains two blocks of trials with 2 repetition of a randomly chosen 8-element-long ASRT sequence.

The trials are squares; the target square appears in turqouise color.

The 'S', 'D', 'J' and 'K' buttons are used as response buttons.

If correct response is given, the next element is presented; however, if the response is wrong (but active response button pressed) the trial occurs again.

Average performance (mean accuracy and mean RT) is given as feedback after the end of the block.

After the end of the task, output data are downloaded to the local machine (CSV format) and presented on the screen in JSON format.
